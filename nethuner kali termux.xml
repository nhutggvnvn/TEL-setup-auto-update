Installation:
Install the NetHunter-Store app from https://store.nethunter.com

From the NetHunter Store, install Termux, NetHunter-KeX client, and Hacker's keyboard Note: The button "install" may not change to "installed" in the store client after installation - just ignore it. Starting termux for the first time may seem stuck while displaying "installing" on some devices - just hit enter.

Open Termux and type:

pkg install wget
wget -O install-nethunter-termux https://offs.ec/2MceZWr
chmod +x install-nethunter-termux
./install-nethunter-termux

Tips:
Run sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade first thing after installation. If you have plenty of storage space available you might want to run apt install kali-linux-default as well.
