Zsh?
Oh-My-Zsh is a framework for Zsh, the Z shell.

In order for Oh-My-Zsh to work, Zsh must be installed.
Please run zsh --version to confirm.
Expected result: zsh 5.4.2 or more recent
Additionally, Zsh should be set as your default shell.
Please run echo $SHELL from a new terminal to confirm.
Expected result: /usr/bin/zsh or similar
Install and set up zsh as default
If necessary, follow these steps to install Zsh:

There are two main ways to install Zsh
with the package manager of your choice, e.g. sudo apt install zsh (see below for more examples)
from source, following instructions from the Zsh FAQ
Verify installation by running zsh --version. Expected result: zsh 5.4.2 or more recent.
Make it your default shell: chsh -s $(which zsh)
Note that this will not work if Zsh is not in your authorized shells list (/etc/shells) or if you don't have permission to use chsh. If that's the case you'll need to use a different procedure.
Log out and log back in again to use your new default shell.
Test that it worked with echo $SHELL. Expected result: /bin/zsh or similar.
Test with $SHELL --version. Expected result: 'zsh 5.4.2' or similar
